event ->
    global conditions
    levels ->
        chance
        conditions

        GlobalVariableData -> per event
        actions ->
            if using function inside another function it should be surrounded by brackets: {}
            store:
                -> Puts a variable inside GlobalVariableData
                -> doesn't need a string

            command:
                -> Variables used: event, GlobalVariableData
                -> executed command based of input
                -> we need a string

                -> How multi variable would work

Inside Functions ->
    example: random number between {random number between {random number between 10 & 20} & 200} & {random number between 200 & 1000}
    first should be parsed: {random number between 10 & 20} and replaced with 0V()
    second should be parsed: {random number between 0V() & 200} and replaced with 1V()
    third should be parsed: {random number between 200 & 1000} and replaced with 2V()
    fourth: should be parsed: random number between 1V() & 2V()
